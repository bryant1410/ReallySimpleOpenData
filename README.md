# ReallySimpleOpenData (RSOD)
A no-frills open data portal built with node, express, mongodb and angular

## Key Tenets
- You don't need expensive or complicated software to have an Open Data Portal
- RSOD is just a catalog.  That's it.  No mapping, charting, APIs, databases, user accounts, etc... 
- Designed around the [data.json catalog standard](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/catalog/#machine-readable-format).  
- Built on a modern stack - MEAN - MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js - Full Stack javascript FTW
- Developed by Civic Hackers and Open Data Enthusiasts who want to give data publishers another open source option for Open Data
